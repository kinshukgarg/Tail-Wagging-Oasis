# Tail-Wagging-Oasis
Tail Wagging Oasis is more than just a project; it's a labor of love and dedication. Built with
Bootstrap, Node.js, and SQL, this endeavor began as a challenging journey. Facing numerous obstacles at the outset, from coding complexities to troubleshooting hurdles, the process was undoubtedly daunting.
However, through perseverance and a commitment to learning, each obstacle became an opportunity for growth. Today, Tail Wagging Oasis stands as a testament to overcoming challenges, with its seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and innovative web technologies. It's not just a project
it's a testament to the power of determination and the joy of creating something truly remarkable.
Starting a Node.js project involves setting up your development environment, including necessary tools and configurations. Below, I will guide you through the steps to set up a Node.js project using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and SQL Workbench, along with configuring Node.js for version control with GitHub.

Step 1: Install Necessary Software
Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Download and install VS Code from the official site.
VS Code will be used as the code editor and development environment.
SQL Workbench:

Download and install SQL Workbench from the official site.
Ensure you have the appropriate JDBC driver for your SQL server. This tool is used to manage your database schemas and run SQL queries.
Node.js:

Download and install Node.js from Node.js official website. This will also install npm (Node package manager), which is essential for managing Node.js packages.
Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub Account:

If you don’t already have an account, sign up at GitHub.
Create a New Repository:

Log into your GitHub account, go to your Repositories tab, and click on 'New' to create a new repository.
Clone the Repository in VS Code:

Open VS Code, go to the Source Control panel, and click on 'Clone Repository'.
Enter the URL of your GitHub repository and select a local directory to save the files.
Step 3: Initialize Your Node.js Project
Open Your Project Folder:

Open VS Code and use File > Open Folder to open the folder where you cloned your GitHub repository.
Initialize Node.js:

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (use Ctrl+`` or navigate to Terminal > New Terminal`).
Run npm init or npm init -y to create a package.json file which will manage all metadata relevant to the project, such as dependencies.
Step 4: Install Node.js Dependencies
Install Express (Example):

In the terminal, run npm install express to install Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Install Additional Packages:

Depending on your project’s needs, install other packages using npm. For instance, if interacting with SQL databases, you might use npm install mysql for MySQL databases.
Step 5: Set Up SQL Workbench
Configure SQL Connection:

Open SQL Workbench and set up a connection to your database using the connection details (host, username, password, database name).
Test SQL Queries:

Run some test queries to ensure that the connection to your database is properly configured.
Step 6: Write Your Application Code
Create a Basic Server:

Use VS Code to write your application code. For example, create a file named app.js and write code to set up a basic server using Express.
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
Run Your Server:

In the terminal, run node app.js to start your server. Visit http://localhost:3000 in a browser to see it running.
Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub
Commit Changes:

In VS Code, go to the Source Control panel, stage your changes, and commit them with a meaningful message.
Push to GitHub:

Click on the synchronize changes icon in VS Code to push your commits to the remote GitHub repository.
These steps will guide you through the setup of a basic Node.js project using VS Code and SQL Workbench, and integrating it with GitHub for version control. This setup is foundational, and you can build upon it depending on the requirements of your specific project.
